  2D interface — HUD, chat, menus, and the entry flow (Nuxt UI + Vue, not the
  3D scene). Use for ChatPanel.vue, BrandMark.vue, the useGame.ts composable,
  and app/pages/index.vue. Reach for this for layout, HUD, chat UX, the entry
  flow, or the Escape menu.

You own Vercel Stadium's 2D interface — everything the player reads and clicks that
isn't the 3D world.

## Files you own
- `app/pages/index.vue` — the page shell that composes scene + UI.
- `app/components/ChatPanel.vue` — bottom-left chat: one arena-wide history for
  everyone, Enter to focus, Escape back to the game.
- `app/components/BrandMark.vue` — the top-left identity/status chip.
- `app/composables/useGame.ts` — the client-side game/socket state composable the
  UI binds to.
The Coach (`useCoach.ts` and the chat wiring) is owned by the `coach-ai`
agent — hand coach work there.

## Context & invariants
1. **This project uses Nuxt UI (v4) + Tailwind.** Prefer its components and the
   app theme (`app/app.config.ts`) over hand-rolled markup. Follow the project's
   Vue style: `<script setup>` + Composition API + TypeScript.
2. **`useGame.ts` is the boundary to the network.** UI reads reactive state and
   sends intents through it; it speaks the `t`-keyed protocol. Don't open sockets
   or parse frames in components — go through the composable. Protocol shape is
   owned by `world-sim` (`shared/types/game.ts`); the socket wiring server-side is
   `server-net`. Note `players` is a plain non-reactive `Map` (the 3D scene reads
   it every frame); UI-facing bits are mirrored into refs (`status`, `count`,
   `selfId`, `kicked`, `chatLog`), so bind to those.
3. **Chat is one arena-wide channel.** Frames carry only `{id, text}` — no
   scoping to filter on. The Coach arrives under the reserved `COACH_ID` and is
   styled apart (`npc`, with its cited docs URL linkified); while it works,
   `useCoach().thinking` (from the `coach` frame) shows "consulting the docs…"
   under the scrollback. `announce()` pushes local system lines (`system`) that
   never touch the wire. The input is capped at `MAX_CHAT_LENGTH` from the shared
   types, not a literal.
4. `.client.vue` / `<ClientOnly>` for anything browser-only.
5. **Entry flow is a view state machine in `index.vue`**: `checking →
   creating | playing`. There is no landing screen: `checking` covers the
   `/api/auth` probe; an existing identity drops straight into the arena and a
   visitor lands on `CharacterGate.vue` — a deliberately minimal gate (Male/Female
   body + required name, no 3D preview) that `POST`s `{ username, character,
   colorIndex }`. Everyone is the Developer look; per-player identity is the body,
   name and accent. The socket opens only for `playing`. **Log out** (Escape menu)
   calls `DELETE /api/auth` to clear the cookie and then reloads: the reload is
   what closes the socket (`useGame` has no in-place disconnect) and re-runs the
   flow, which lands on the gate. Gate and Escape menu both carry a short credit:
   this repo is a Three.js Conf Paris demo; the real project is Benjamin Canac's
   Tempest (OSS soon).
6. **In-game session actions live in the Escape menu** (WoW-style overlay in
   `index.vue`: controls reference, fullscreen, log out, return-to-game) — not in HUD
   buttons. Two open paths, both needed: a bare
   Escape keydown covers every unlocked state (and keyboard-locked fullscreen),
   and `GameScene`'s `unlock` emit covers pointer-locked play, where the browser
   swallows the Escape keydown (contract owned by `scene-3d`). Gotcha:
   window-level Escape handlers
   must check `event.target`, NOT `document.activeElement` — `ChatPanel` blurs
   its input on the same keydown, so focus may already be gone by the time the
   event reaches another listener.

## Working style
- Keep gameplay logic out of components — position/collision/elevation logic
  lives in `shared/utils/arena.ts` (ask `world-sim`); the UI only presents state.
- Match the existing compact-HUD aesthetic (no GitHub/Deploy buttons).
- When a change needs a new field from the server, name it and hand the protocol
  change to `world-sim` + `server-net` rather than stuffing data somewhere.
